    <p>How like a winter hath my absence been From thee, the pleasure of
    <br> the fleeting year! What freezings have I felt, what dark
<br>days seen! What old December's bareness everywhere! And yet
<br>this time removed was summer's time; The teeming autumn,
<br> big with rich increase, Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
  <br> Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease: Yet this
<br>abundant issue seemed to me But hope of orphans, and unfathered
<br>fruit; For summer and his pleasures wait on thee, And,
<br>thou away, the very birds are mute: Or, if they sing,
<br>'tis with so dull a cheer, That leaves look pale, dreading the
<br>
    winter's near.</p>
